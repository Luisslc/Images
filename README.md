First step
The first thing we have done is create a GitHub environment for all members of the group.

Second step
We have done web scraping of a Spanish sign page in Virtual Code and it seems that we were all trying to enter that page and when I tried it I got a "Connection aborted" error because the page crashed and could not be accessed.

Third step
Not being able to connect to that website and others with movement signs, we have downloaded a csv with all the sign language in kaggle.

Fourth step
We have gone to the "Roboflow" page and we have been labeling each letter, we have used three images for each letter of the alphabet and we have downloaded the new dataset with our labeled images.

Fifth step
The model has given us 61% accuracy and we have tested it with the mobile phone to see if it detected the signs, it did detect the images but since it has low resolution it was very difficult for it to catch it since it was going at 1fps on my mobile phone.

EXTRAS
We have had problems downloading the files and uploading the visual code and uploading to github since having many samples in the sample set took a long time to load.
